# BiomassSpeciesData

This repository contains the [LandWebProprietaryData](https://github.com/eliotmcintire/LandWeb/tree/development/m/LandWebProprietaryData) `SpaDES` module (part of [eliotmcintire/LandWeb](https://github.com/eliotmcintire/LandWeb)), expanded to include the download and preparation (i.e. overlaying) of the kNN species biomass data (see http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/climate-change/tools-resources/18372#mofp for info on the kNN dataset).

As of now, this module focuses on Canada-wide (tree) species biomass data, but can eventually be expanded to other types of data and geographic locations.

## TO DO:
* tranform this SpaDES module into an R-package that will be hosted @PredictiveEcology
